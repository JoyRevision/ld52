### Brainstorming


Ideas:

- First person underwater ship exploration, harvest pearls from giant clams and try not to get smacked
- 2D, Flying ship through caves, Pick up gems with tethers (a la dome keeper), avoid spikes and profit
- Alien ship where you harvest pesky farmers (too many farming games)
  - There are too many farmers harvesting crops in the simulation, Agent 74, please go collect them and dispose of them in the bin.
- Rabbit farmer top down shooter
  - shoots trowels at carrot monsters

**Farmer Rabbit's Wild Ride**

Dear Farmer Rabbit,

An Evil Veg-Romancer has taken over the kingdom with their army of necro-crops. We believe their next target is your
carrot patch.

Good Luck, it's Harvesting Time.

**Alien Ship** -- Harvester Harvesting (working title):

For some reason there has been a massive increase in the number of farmers growing crops. The simulation cannot
handle the increase in seeds being sown.

We need you to collect some farmers and deposit them in the bin ships (other alien ships flying by that have a bucket on top)

Despite being an advanced alien spaceship in an advanced simulation, you must operate at night.

Ship flies around with a hook. Farmers are picked up and float at a random range distance from the ship on a tether.
Deposit as many farmers as you can before the sun comes up.

Avoid the birds, they will fly through tethers and cause farmers to drop back to the ground and begin sow crops.

Controls:
W/Up - go up
S/Down - go down
A/Left - go left
D/Right - go right

Space/E/Left Click - grab farmer
X/Right Click - drop all farmers


Wants:

- 2D Pixel art
- Line drawn for tether
- Ability to chuck / drop farmers into other ships
- Parallax background
- Funny noises
